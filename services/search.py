"""
services/search.py — Hybrid full-text and vector document retrieval.

This module exposes three public functions used by the Streamlit UI:

- :func:`hybrid_search` — The core retrieval function. Called for every user
  question to find the most relevant document chunks.
- :func:`get_indexed_document_names` — Returns the list of documents that have
  been indexed, used to populate the Summary tab dropdown.
- :func:`fetch_chunks_by_document` — Retrieves *all* chunks for one document
  in reading order, used to build the full-document summary.

**Hybrid search explained**

Azure AI Search supports two complementary retrieval strategies that are
combined in a single request:

* **Full-text (BM25)** — Matches documents based on term frequency and inverse
  document frequency.  Fast but purely keyword-based; misses synonyms and
  paraphrases.
* **Vector (ANN/HNSW)** — Matches documents whose embedding vectors are
  closest to the query embedding in semantic space.  Captures meaning even
  when exact keywords differ.

Azure AI Search fuses the two score lists using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion
(RRF)**, which re-ranks results by their combined positions rather than raw
scores, producing a single unified ranking that is typically better than
either strategy alone.

def hybrid_search(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[dict]:
    """Retrieve the most relevant document chunks for a user query.

    Performs a **hybrid search** that combines traditional BM25 full-text
    matching with HNSW approximate nearest-neighbour vector similarity.  Both
    strategies run in a single request to Azure AI Search and the results are
    merged using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) before the top-``k`` are
    returned.

    Steps:
        1. Embed the query string into a float vector using
           :func:`~services.embeddings.generate_embeddings`.
        2. Wrap the vector in a ``VectorizedQuery`` targeting the
           ``content_vector`` field.
        3. Issue a Search request that supplies both ``search_text`` (for
           BM25) and ``vector_queries`` (for ANN).
        4. Map the raw search results to plain dictionaries and return them.

    Args:
        query (str): The user's natural-language question.  This string is
            both embedded (for vector search) and used as-is for full-text
            search.
        top_k (int): Maximum number of results to return.  Passed to both
            the vector query (``k_nearest_neighbors``) and the overall search
            request (``top``).  Defaults to ``5``.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: Up to ``top_k`` result dictionaries ordered from most to
            least relevant.  Each dictionary contains:
            - ``id`` (str): Unique chunk identifier.
            - ``content`` (str): Full text of the matching chunk.
            - ``page_number`` (int): Source page number (used for citations).
            - ``score`` (float): RRF fusion score assigned by Azure AI Search
              (higher is more relevant).

    Raises:
        azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError: If the search service is
            unavailable or returns an error response.
        openai.AuthenticationError: If the embedding API key is invalid.

    Example:
        >>> results = hybrid_search("What are the main findings?", top_k=3)
        >>> results[0]['page_number']

    sorting.

    The function fetches up to 1000 results.  For production use-cases with a
    very large number of documents, this should be replaced with a proper

    Issues a wildcard search with an OData filter on ``document_name`` to

    reading order, which may differ from the order returned by the search API.
